# FontMaker

FontMakeris a very quickly hacked together program that is used to generate font files. 
The generated font file is what LibGdx reqires to make BitmapFonts.

For example use, see Main.java. You'll probably also need to manually edit the settings in
FontGenerator.java.

This project is public domain except for the assets which are under the same licence as Texxel. 
You can steal whatever code you like, although I can't understand why you would want to :P
